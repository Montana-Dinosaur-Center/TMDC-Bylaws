# Bylaws Repository
This is the bylaws  repository of the Montana Dinosaur Center. The current bylaws can be found in [bylaws.md](https://github.com/Montana-Dinosaur-Center/bylaws/blob/main/bylaws.md)

My long term hope for this project is to create an archive all past changes to the bylaws so they can reflect a timeline from creation to current iteration.
